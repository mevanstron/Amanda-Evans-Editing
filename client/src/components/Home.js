        <p>An editor can take your fresh, original draft and make it polished, professional, and error-free. The secret is to pour it out of your head, and send it on to a really good editor who will preserve your style.</p>
        <p>This simple change in your writing process will free you up to be more creative and spontaneous. Even with technical or scientific writing, the best and most accurate information is usually what comes out first.</p>
        <p>With an editor on board, you never have to worry about mistakes when you are letting the creative juices flow.</p>
